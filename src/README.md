## ðŸ“Œ What Are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices refined through experience and are divided into several categories.

## ðŸ§± Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms. They aim to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation, increasing flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### Included Patterns:

- **Singleton** â€“ Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
- **Prototype** â€“ Creates duplicate objects while keeping performance in mind.
- **Builder** â€“ Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- **Abstract Factory** â€“ Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects.
- **Factory Method** â€“ Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

Each pattern is implemented in its own directory.
